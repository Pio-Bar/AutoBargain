# AutoBargain
## _Mock used car dealership webapp._

AutoBargain is a simple webapp build with Bootstrap 5 and VanillaJS. It allows the user to browse a list of cars and order the chosen vehicle, by using a form that validates and gives appropriate feedback. It uses local storage to retain form data and additional user preferences until the order is finalized.

You can take a look at a hosted project thanks to [github pages.](https://piobargit.github.io/AutoHustler/)
